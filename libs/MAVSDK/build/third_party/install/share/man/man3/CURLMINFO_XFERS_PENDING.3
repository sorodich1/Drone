.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLMcode curl_multi_get_offt(CURLM *handle, CURLMINFO_XFERS_PENDING,
                              curl_off_t *pvalue);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The number of current easy handles waiting to start. An added transfer might
become pending for various reasons: a connection limit forces it to wait,
resolving DNS is not finished or it is not clear if an existing, matching
connection may allow multiplexing (HTTP/2 or HTTP/3).

n/a

This functionality affects all supported protocols
